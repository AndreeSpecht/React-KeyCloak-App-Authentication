Keycloak Secure Customer Manager
A full-stack application demonstrating a robust, end-to-end security model for a modern web system. It features a Java/Spring Boot backend API and a React frontend, with all authentication and role-based authorization centrally managed by Keycloak.

‚ú® Features
Full CRUD Functionality: Create, Read, Update, and Delete customer data.
Centralized Authentication: User login is fully delegated to Keycloak using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
API Protection: Each API endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) requires a specific user role.
Dynamic UI: Frontend components (buttons, forms) are rendered conditionally based on the logged-in user's roles.
Secure Token Handling: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) issued by Keycloak to manage user sessions and authorize API requests.
Decoupled Architecture: Clean separation between the identity provider, backend API, and frontend client.
